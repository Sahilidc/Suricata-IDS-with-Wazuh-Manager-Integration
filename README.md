# Suricata IDS with Wazuh Manager Integration
This project showcases the integration of Suricata IDS on a Wazuh agent, where all intrusion detection logs are forwarded to the Wazuh manager for centralized monitoring and analysis. The setup includes demonstrating an intrusion detection scenario using an Nmap scan from Kali Linux.

#### Setup and Configuration
##### Prerequisites
Suricata IDS installed on the Wazuh agent.
Wazuh Manager deployed and configured to receive logs from Suricata

###### Step 1: Install and Configure Suricata on the AgentStep 1: Install and Configure Suricata on the Agent

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata

```
Configure Suricata to monitor the appropriate network interface and set up logging:
```
nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

```

Ensure the outputs section is configured to output logs in a format compatible with Wazuh.

###### Step 2: Forward Suricata Logs to Wazuh ManageStep 2: Forward Suricata Logs to Wazuh Manage

Modify the ossec.conf file on the Wazuh agent to forward Suricata logs:
```
nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

```
    
###### Step 3: Configure Wazuh Manager to Receive Suricata Logs

Modify the Wazuh manager configuration to handle Suricata logs:
```
nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

```

###### Step 4: Validate the Setup
1) Perform an Nmap scan from Kali Linux to simulate an intrusion.
2) Verify that Suricata detects the scan and generates logs.
3)Check the Wazuh manager for real-time updates and log entries related to the        intrusion.

##### Viewing Intrusion Events

Access the Wazuh manager interface.
Navigate to the "Security Events" or "Logs" section to view Suricata-generated alerts.
